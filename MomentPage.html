 We plan to join Maulid Akbar which has been held at Masjid Mu’adz bin Jabal, Setiawangsa. It was a very last minute plan, we rent a car for 2 days to go there which cost around RM 200. It was an honor to join the event, I was very lucky that I got a chance to handshake with Habib Ali Zaenal Abidin al Hamid. He even offers me with few of my friends to eat together with him. It's been a long time since I join an event like that so it’s quite fun and exciting to be there.  </td>

I join Melaka Rock The City Festival which has been held at Dataran Pahlawan Melaka with my friends. I went to Melaka alone by riding a motorcycle, similar to when I join House of Vans in 2019. I met my friends in Melaka then we go there together. I get a chance to take a photo together with one of my favorite singers, Iqbal from the Iqbal M band. My friend lost his motorcycle bike during join the crowd, we were panic and can’t concentrate on the show. After 15 minutes of searching and we can’t find the key, we decide to continue with the show first and hope to find it later. Luckily it was found after the event finish

It’s my first time being the organizer of any event so I was very nervous that the event might be ruin because of me. I take about 2 weeks to set up the event to make sure it will be done smoothly. The event was run smoothly and I felt very relieved that there is no unwanted incident that happened during the event.</td>
